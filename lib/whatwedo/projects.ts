Their existing monitoring tools couldn't keep up with the scale and velocity of their metrics data, leading to delayed incident response and poor operational visibility.",
    challenge: "The existing monitoring infrastructure was fragmented across multiple tools, causing alert fatigue with false positives, delayed incident detection (15-20 minute lag), and difficulty correlating events across services. The team needed a unified platform that could process 500K+ metrics per second with sub-100ms latency while providing intelligent alerting and historical analysis.",
    approach: "We architected a distributed event-driven system leveraging WebSocket for real-time streaming, Redis for in-memory caching and pub/sub, and TimescaleDB for time-series storage.

    challenge: "The company's legacy routing system couldn't adapt to real-time conditions like traffic, weather, or last-minute order changes. Manual dispatch decisions led to suboptimal routes, with vehicles traveling 30% more miles than necessary. Customer satisfaction scores were declining due to missed delivery windows, and fuel costs were eating into margins.",

    challenge: "The existing monolithic system had single points of failure, couldn't handle peak transaction volumes (causing 3-4 hours of delays), and fraud detection was rule-based with a 7% false positive rate. They needed PCI-DSS Level 1 compliance, real-time FX conversion, and the ability to add new payment providers without system downtime.",

Patient records were siloed, making it impossible to get a complete clinical picture.

The network needed real-time interoperability while maintaining strict HIPAA compliance and sub-second query performance.",
